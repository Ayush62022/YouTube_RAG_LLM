# YouTube_RAG_LLM
## Introduction
This project leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies including LangChain, OpenAI (GPT-3.5 Turbo), Pinecone, and Whisper to transcribe YouTube videos, analyze the content, and answer specific questions based on the video content. It showcases the power of AI in understanding and extracting insights from video content.
### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid model that combines the power of retrieval-based and generative AI models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text. In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), RAG models first retrieve relevant information from a vast corpus of data (the retrieval part) and then use this information to generate coherent, contextually relevant text (the generation part).

### Whisper
Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI that can transcribe spoken language into text. It's known for its robust performance across a wide range of languages and audio conditions.
### Pinecone
Pinecone is a vector database that enables efficient similarity search at scale. It's designed to support vector search applications where items are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, and the goal is to find the most similar items based on vector proximity. 
## Step Involve For Building The Project
### Environment Setup and Initial Configuration
#### Importing Necessary Libraries: 
The script begins by importing required Python libraries, including os for operating system interactions, load_dotenv for environment variable management, and various components from langchain, whisper, pytube, and others.

#### Loading Environment Variables:
It loads environment variables, such as the OpenAI API key, which are crucial for accessing APIs securely.

### Preparing the Chat Model
Initializing the Chat Model: A ChatOpenAI model instance is created, specifying the OpenAI API key and the model version to use (gpt-3.5-turbo). This model is intended for interacting with OpenAI's language models.
### Transcribing YouTube Videos
#### Downloading and Transcribing YouTube Video:
The script downloads the audio stream of a YouTube video using pytube and transcribes it using the whisper model. This results in a text file containing the transcription of the video's audio.

#### Reading the Transcription: 
The transcribed text is read from the file, making it available for further processing.

### Processing and Analyzing the Transcription
#### Text Processing with Langchain:
Using langchain, the script demonstrates how to process the transcribed text, including splitting it into manageable chunks and generating embeddings for queries.

#### Setting Up a Vector Store:
A vector store is set up using either an in-memory solution or Pinecone, which facilitates efficient similarity searches within the transcribed content. This is crucial for finding relevant sections of the transcription based on specific queries.

#### Querying and Extracting Information: 
The script showcases how to query the processed transcription to extract specific information, such as details about certain topics mentioned in the video.

### Advanced Text Interaction
#### Combining Chains for Complex Queries:
By combining different processing chains, the script can handle more complex queries, such as translating responses or finding specific pieces of information within the transcribed text.

#### Utilizing Pinecone for Scalable Vector Search:
Finally, it demonstrates setting up a Pinecone vector store for scalable and efficient similarity searches, which is especially useful for larger datasets or more complex queries.
